# Reduce Punctuation

Your writing relies on strong composition. Punctuation marks exist to enhance clear prose and not compensate for weak structure. Minimize parentheses and em-dashes and quotes and ampersands.

## Always
- Structure first: Rewrite because better structure removes the need for marks
- Sentence flow: Integrate information into the main sentence flow
- Document consistency: Apply em-dashes throughout a document or not at all
- Direct statement: State skepticism directly in text rather than through quotes
- Prose style: Write "and" in all prose

## Never
- Parenthetical hiding: Use parentheses to hide integration failures behind marks
- Em-dash overuse: Use em-dashes for simple clarifications that belong in the sentence
- Quote masking: Use quotes to mask imprecise wording with false skepticism
- Ampersand mixing: Combine & with "and" in parallel structures
- Punctuation shortcuts: Choose punctuation over sentence improvement

## Steps
1. Identify punctuation temptation
2. Rewrite with better structure
3. Evaluate necessity
4. Apply only when genuine value exists
5. Verify document consistency

## Examples

✅ Good:
- The system requires authentication before access
- Research and development teams collaborate daily
- The term agile has lost specific meaning in modern practice

❌ Bad:
- The system (which was built last year) requires authentication (parentheses hide integration failure)
- Consider—and this is important—whether structure helps (em-dash for simple clarification)
- Research & development and marketing teams (mixed ampersand with and)

## Marks
### Parentheses
- Integration only: Use only when information genuinely cannot integrate
- Default avoidance: Avoid by default

### Em-dashes
- Rhythm reserve: Reserve for rhythm or emphasis only
- Clarification choice: Parentheses over em-dashes for clarifications

### Quotes
- Valid skepticism: Valid for genuine skepticism or irony
- Invalid workaround: Invalid as workaround for imprecision

### Ampersand
- Prose spelling: Spell out in prose
- Proper names: Allow only in proper names
